    - who am I?
    - problem - BDD, features made for devs but behaviour belongs to everyone
    - feature content needs to come out of text files and live in a place where it can be shared and collaborated on
    - Wave - a platform for collaboration, has a nifty robot API - automated participants, realtime collaboration - why can't features live here?
    - Demo
      - add a feature to a new wave
      - invite bumpy
      - drop config into env file
      - run - see highlight and metadata blip
      - add scenarios to make it pass
      - run again and look at Wave
      - hooks up a wave by inserting tags
    - Bumps - Cucumber (vegetable) --> speech bubble (Jason voorhees) --> Robot (Marvin) down and back up
      - Wave --> Robot --> JSON(Features) --> Cucumber with Bumps --> JSON(results) --> Robot --> Wave
    - Bumps URL, Bumpybot URL (hack - needs redoing and testing properly)
      - Next: more usable robot with more information
              - dynamic gadget to indicate last modification time
              - indication that someone has edited the blip since the run
  
  
LATER
- split FeatureWavelet into FeatureBlip
- organise utils
- TESTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- visual indicator of the wave being edited - bold and unbold title?
- return better output to cukes
  - updated OK
  - version mismatch
