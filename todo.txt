- better colours
- split up Bumpy - way too big
- organise utils
- better join message - []
  
  Thanks for inviting me! Install the <bumps gem> and drop this into *env.rb* to get rolling:
  
  require 'bumps'
  
  Bumps.configure do
    pull_from 'http://localhost:1981'
    push_to 'url'
  end

- get both ready to release and test [][]

- presentation[][][][]
  - 5 slides
    - who am I?
    - problem - BDD, features made for devs but behaviour belongs to everyone
    - feature content needs to come out of text files and live in a place where it can be shared and collaborated on
    - Wave - a platform for collaboration, has a nifty robot API - automated participants, realtime collaboration - why can't features live here?
    - Demo
      - add a feature to a new wave
      - invite bumpy
      - drop config into env file
      - run - see highlight and metadata blip
      - add scenarios to make it pass
      - run again and look at Wave
      - hooks up a wave by inserting tags
    - Bumps - Cucumber (vegetable) --> speech bubble (Jason voorhees) --> Robot (Marvin) down and back up
      - Wave --> Robot --> JSON(Features) --> Cucumber with Bumps --> JSON(results) --> Robot --> Wave
    - Bumps URL, Bumpybot URL (hack - needs redoing and testing properly)
      - Next: more usable robot with more information
  
  
LATER
- break up Bumpybot - too big
- remove utils
- return better output to cukes
  - updated OK
  - version mismatch
